# Why should developers study writing?

If you've picked up this book, then you're probably a software developer.
Furthermore, you're someone who cares about your career.
You've probably spent countless hours
studying manuals,
reading library docs,
learning how to write clean code,
and otherwise mastering your craft.

But you may be skeptical.
There are a thousand other things you could learn.
Why spend the time studying writing?
Let's walk through some of the things you might be thinking.

## Objection 1: I'm paid to code, not to write.

In most cases, developers aren't paid to code.
We are paid to produce working software that solves a business problem.
In order to do that we may need to:

* Email a product manager to clarify a requirement
* Instant message a designer to verify the color and placement of a call-to-action button
* Document the details of an internal REST API
* Submit a patch to an open-source project you use
* File a bug report about a part of the software developed by another team
* Provide explanatory notes about that spike in server errors on the 14th
* Tweak the wording of some UI text that is confusing users,
  since the designer is unavailable

All of these things are run of the mill tasks for a software developer.
And every single one of them is a form of writing.

## Objection 2: I already know how to write. I did well in school.

Unfortunately, literacy,
even at college or university level,
doesn't guarantee the ability to write effectively.
Many degree programs place little emphasis on writing.
And those that do emphasize it often encourage an academic style which doesn't mesh well with most developer's jobs.

Academic writing tends to value a kind of distant objectivity which can manifest as:

* Unnecessary jargon
* Verbose and indirect prose
* Extreme formality

In contrast, most developers would benefit from making their prose clear, direct, and concise.

## Objection 3: But I could be studying the Hoth framework instead. It's so cool!

Yes, no matter which topic you decide to study,
you will be passing up something else.
But writing deserves special consideration.
Why?
**Because writing is a durable skill.**

Technology changes quickly.
If you're not careful,
you can easily invest a lot of time and energy into a technological one hit wonder.
Writing, though, will never be rendered obsolete by the fickle winds of technology or fashion.

**Writing is also a transferable skill.**
If you decide to change careers and become a
realtor,
landscape artist,
or -- God forbid! -- a manager,
your expertise in the Hoth MVVM framework will be of limited use.
But writing will remain.
