# General Rules

Rules. The very word can trigger skepticism. And understandably so. We are often confronted with seemingly arbitrary rules which make our lives harder for no apparent reason.

In this chapter, I will give you rules to follow, but I will also explain each rule's rationale. so if you find yourself in a situation beyond the scope of the rule, you'll be equipped to make intelligent decisions about how or if to apply it.

It is also important to acknowledge the limits of these rules. They are targeted principally at writing within a professional business context. If you are writing a novel, these rules will be of limited use. And if you are writing poetry, they will probably be entirely useless. But if you need to communicate ideas to your coworkers, then these rules will serve you well.

Now that we've set the appropriate context, let's look at those rules.

## 1. Be goal oriented.

### Everything you write has a goal

Suppose a boss or client came to you and said they needed you to build a web application. Your first question would probably be, "What is the application for?" The very idea of writing an application without knowing its purpose is ridiculous. Yet when it comes to writing prose, we too often fail to ask the obvious question.

Everything you write has a goal, whether explicit or implicit. Those API docs? The stated goal is to inform other developers how to use your library. That weekly status report you email your client? The unstated goal  is reassuring them that their money is being well spent.

The goal of a document isn't always obvious, but in the next chapter, we'll look at some tools to figure it out.

### Knowing the goal equips you to fulfill it.

Let's go back to our hypothetical web application above. Suppose you did try to build it without actually knowing its purpose? You are just given a list of features and told to start building. What would happen?

You'd have no way to evaluate how well or poorly the application was doing. And that's not just a problem at the end. All along you'd have questions about how best to build each feature. But without knowing the application's purpose, you'd have no way of choosing between the alternatives. That kind of uncertainty is crippling. And I suspect that is why many people avoid writing.

But when you do know the goal you are writing toward, decisions are easier, and it is simpler to tell whether your writing succeeds in achieving its end.

### The structure of goals

We've talked about goals a lot, but so  far we haven't really clarified what kind of goals we're talking about. It's all about the document.

In this book, when I talk about goals, I mean the purpose intrinsic to the document[^telos], not the author's personal motivations. For instance, your goal in writing API docs may be to keep your tech lead from bugging you about it yet again. But the purpose of the docs themselves are to help assist users of the API.

A document's goals will generally fall into one of two categories: to inform or tow persuade. Most documents will include a bit of both, but one will be primary. To go back to the API docs example, it may help persuade people to user your library, but the primary purpose is just to inform them about how to do so.

[^telos]: If you're familiar with ancient Greek philosophy, this is what Aristotle would call the document's _telos_.
